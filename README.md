    Each calculator is in a separate tab.
    Shared components like ttk.Notebook are used to organize tabs.
    Individual calculation methods are encapsulated for clarity.
    User-friendly error handling is implemented.


The Solar Calculator Suite is a comprehensive Python-based GUI application created using Tkinter. It combines multiple calculators into a single program to aid in solar energy planning and analysis. The interface uses a ttk.Notebook to provide easy navigation between different calculators, each focused on specific aspects of solar energy systems.
Key Features

    User-Friendly Interface:
        A tabbed layout using ttk.Notebook, with each calculator accessible from its own tab.
        Clear labels, entry fields, and results display for ease of use.

    Modular Calculators:
        Each tab focuses on a specific calculation or functionality:
            kWh Calculator: Determines the size of the solar system needed based on annual energy needs and peak sunlight hours.
            Savings Calculator: Estimates annual savings based on the solar system size, sunlight hours, and electricity costs.
            Payback Calculator: Calculates the payback period for a solar system, factoring in costs, rebates, and annual savings.
            Solar Panel Calculator: Calculates the required solar panel output based on daily energy consumption and peak sunlight hours.
            Battery Bank Calculator: Determines the size of a battery bank, considering energy requirements, system voltage, and depth of discharge.
            Inverter Size Calculator: Estimates the recommended inverter size based on peak power demands.

    Error Handling:
        Provides meaningful error messages when invalid inputs are detected.
        Ensures users input numeric values in all fields.

    Efficiency Enhancements:
        Includes practical assumptions like inefficiency buffers (e.g., 25% buffer for solar panels, 20% for inverters).
        Uses clear and concise formulas for all calculations.

    Dynamic Results:
        Results are displayed immediately upon clicking the "Calculate" button in each tab.
        Outputs are formatted for readability (e.g., $ for savings, kW for solar size, etc.).
